/**
 * Interface for an entity-specific modifier of miasma infection.
 * <p>
 *     Implementations of this interface are able to block actions or tweak properties of a miasma infection.<br/>
 *     It can be used as a capability interface or directly.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     This interface may be implemented as an item specific alternative to responding to
 *     {@link name.dashkal.minecraft.miasma.api.events.MiasmaEvent} events. Implementations will be consulted
 *     <em>before</em> firing an event.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     When used as an item capability, certain items are automatically checked and will be applied if present.<br/>
 *     Any item implementing this capability that is held in the main hand, the off hand, or own in any of the four
 *     armor slots will be considered "active" and will be consulted for infection actions.<br/>
 *     If the Curios mod is installed, the curio slots are checked as well.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Note: The default implementation for this capability does nothing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     To use this interface in a non-capability context, or to have Miasma search for items in other places,
 *     {@link MiasmaModifierLocator}s may be registered during the
 *     {@link net.minecraftforge.fml.event.lifecycle.InterModEnqueueEvent} mod lifecycle event.

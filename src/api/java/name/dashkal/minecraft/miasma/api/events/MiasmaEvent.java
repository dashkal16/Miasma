/**
 * Superclass for all events relating to the Miasma infection.
 * <p>
 *     Mods may listen to these events to be informed of changes to a Miasma infection.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Some events are {@code Cancellable}.  Canceling such an event blocks the action from occurring.  This may be used
 *     to implement protection mechanics.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     There is also a gear specific method of responding to miasma infection events available by attaching the
 *     {@link IMiasmaModifier} capability to an item.  Implementations of
 *     that capability will be consulted <em>before</em> firing a {@link MiasmaEvent}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     All of these events are dispatched on the {@link net.minecraftforge.common.MinecraftForge#EVENT_BUS} bus on both
 *     the client and server.

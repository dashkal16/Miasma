     *     It <em>is</em> safe to instantiate these from a mod's constructor, but remember that mod loading is
     *     performed in parallel, so be sure <em>not</em> to actually attempt to access a mod's classes until
     *     their API documentation indicates that it is safe to do so.  Generally this means at least
     *     {@link net.minecraftforge.fml.event.lifecycle.FMLCommonSetupEvent}.  Also as the loading is parallel, be sure
     *     to follow appropriate thread safety practices.  Use
     *     {@link net.minecraftforge.fml.event.lifecycle.ParallelDispatchEvent#enqueueWork(Runnable)} as required.

     *     Note: The only way to be sure to avoid classloader errors is if the caller passes a direct static method
